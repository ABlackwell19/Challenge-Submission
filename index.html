            <p>Air pollution is when harmful are present in the air we breathe. These can come from cars, factories, and even natural sources like wildfires. The main culprits are gases like nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and tiny particles known as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10).</p>

            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>Air pollution can lead to serious health issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Respatory problems (like asthma)</li>
                <li>Heart disease</li>
                <li>Premature death</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's especially dangerous for children, older adults, and people with existing health issues. Air pollution also harms the planet, contributing to climate change.</p>

        <section id="how-it-is-measured">
            <h2>How It's Measured</h2>
            <p>We monitor air pollution using:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Air Quality Index (AQI):</strong> A simple way to report how polluted the air is.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring Stations:</strong> Devices that measure pollution levels at specific locations.</li>
                <li><strong>Satellites:</strong> They provide a bird's-eye view of pollution patterns.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="actions">
            <h2>What Can Be Done?</h2>
            <p>We can all help reduce air pollution by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using public transport or biking instead of driving</li>
                <li>Supporting clean energy solutions, like solar and wind power</li>
                <li>Advocating for stricter pollution regulations</li>
            </ul>
